# Exercise Guidelines

# Level 1
- ## Exercise 1
    From a list of Strings, type a method that returns a list of all strings containing the letter 'o'. Print the result.

- ## Exercise 2
    You have to do the same as in the previous point, but now, the method must return a list with the Strings that in addition to containing the letter ‘o’ also have more than 5 letters. Print the result.

- ## Exercise 3
    Create a list with the names of the months of the year. Prints all list items with a lambda.

- ## Exercise 4
    Print the same list of the previous exercise, but using method reference.

- ## Exercise 5
    Create a Functional Interface with a method called getPiValue() that must return a double. From main() of the main class, instance the interface and assign the value 3.1415 to it. Invoke the getPiValue() method and prints the result.

- ## Exercise 6
    Create a list with numbers and text strings and sort the list with the shortest to longest strings.

- ## Exercise 7
    With the list of the previous year, now sort it backwards, from longer to shorter chain.

- ## Exercise 8
    Create a Functional Interface containing a method called reverse(). This method must receive and return a String. In main() of the main class, inject the body of the method to the created interface through a lambda, so that it returns the same string it receives as a parameter but reversed. Invoke the interface instance by passing a string and check if the result is correct.
# Level 2

- ## Exercise 1
    Create a list of strings with proper names. Write a method that returns a list of all strings starting with the letter 'A' (uppercase) and have exactly 3 letters. Print the result.

- ## Exercise 2
    Schedule a method that returns a comma-separated string, based on a list of Integers. Each element must be preceded by letter “e” if the number is even, or by letter “o” if the number is odd. For example, if the entry list is (3, 55, 44), the output must be “o3, o55, e44”. Print the result.

- ## Exercise 3
    Create a Functional Interface containing a method called operation(). This method must return a float. Inject the body of the method to the created interface through a lambda, so that the operation can be transformed with a sum, a subtraction, a multiplication and a division.

- ## Exercise 4
    Create a list containing some strings of text and numbers.

    Sort by:\
    Alphabetically by the first character. (Note: charAt(0) returns the numeric code of the first character)\
    Strings that contain an "e" first, the rest of the strings later. Put the code directly into the lambda.\
    Modify all items in the list that have an 'a'. Modify the ‘a’ by a ‘4’.\
    Show only items that are numeric. (Although they are saved as Strings).
