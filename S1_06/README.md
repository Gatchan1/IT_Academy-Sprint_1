# Exercise Guidelines

# Level 1
- ## Exercise 1
    Create a class called NoGenericMethods that stores three arguments of the same type, along with methods for storing and extracting these objects and a constructor for initializing all three. Check that arguments can be put in any position in the call to the builder.

- ## Exercise 2
    Create a class called Person with the attributes name, surname and age. Then create a class called GenericMethods with a generic method that accepts three generic arguments. This method should only print on screen the arguments it has received. In main() of the main class, it calls the generic method with different types of parameters.

    Example: an object of the Persona class, a String and a primitive type.

    In this way you have checked that you can pass any type of parameter and in any order.

# Level 2
- ## Exercise 1
    Modify the previous exercise so that one of the arguments of the generic method is not generic.

- ## Exercise 2
    Modify the previous section so that the generic method arguments are a list of indefinite variable arguments.
